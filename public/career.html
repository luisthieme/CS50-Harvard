                        <b>KINDERGARDEN</b>. Well not a lot happend here to be honest. I had a very joyfull time in kindergarden and spent alot of time outside.
                        This habit of spending as much time outside the house as I can still stuck with me till today.

                        <b>ELEMENTARY SCHOOL</b>. In elementary school I've learned alot of valuable things. Not only about basic math and skills like
                        writing and reading. Most importantly I learned strengths and weaknesses of myself. I noticed that I was much more talented
                        in subjects that had to do with numbers rather than with words. I struggeled to indentify wheter a word was a subject or a verb
                        in my german class but had no problems solving math problems that were meant for older students. A few friends I met here will also
                        become and stay my best friends till today.

                        <b>HIGH SCHOOL</b>. The trend of liking numbers better than words continued in high school which in my country,
                        Germany is called "Gymnasium". I choose a more scientific school that focused on teaching subjects like math, bioligy,
                        chemistry, physics and computer science more than others. The last two of those subjects are also the subjects I succeeded
                        in most during my school time. Except for those two tho I quickly realised that school was boring and our german school system
                        broken. Good grades were not given to the best students but to the most likable and the test often did not require any understanding
                        of the topics but were more of repeating facts you learned by heart the days before. Fortunatly I was gifted with the handy ability
                        to remember everything I see and understsand quite quickly so exams were never a challange for me. The only subject I really
                        liked in school was physics. Our teacher was great and because the interest in physics was low in my year we 
                        were tutored in a class of only 9 students which was amazing. In 2023 i graduated from my school
                        with the highest degree my country offers: "Abitur".

                        <b>NORWAY 2023</b>. After school I've had a few weeks to spare before I would continue my education and also start
                        working properly on a everyday basis for the first time in my life. Alot of my friends decided to visit spain for a
                        week or even two to get black out drunk and party everyday to celebrate their degree. Althoug there is nothing wrong
                        with the idea of partying my stomach told me that this was a great opportunity to start an adventure that I would
                        remember my entire life instead of getting drunk (and with my stomach I mean mostly my mom). So me and a friend I am 
                        proud to call one of my best friends to this day started to plan a trip to norway. We wandet to drive there by car and book
                        playces to stay for the night on the fly when ever we felt like it. Well ofcourse not everything went as planned but still
                        those weeks in the wild created some of the greatest memories of my life which i will never forget. I am forever grateful to
                        my parents and grandparents who made this trip possible financially and Nils who i shared this experience with. <br> <a class="general-links" href="picturesOfNorway.html">Some Pictures from the trip.</a>

                        <b>DUAL STUDY 2023-2027</b>. On the first of August 2023 my journey as a software engineer finally begins. After a few internships
                        at <a class="general-links" href="https://www.5minds.de/">5Minds</a> which reach back to my high school time, I got a job as a dual student in the company.
                        For everyone unfamiliar with the name: A dual student is an employee who works part time for the company while studying part time at Uni.
                        This company was not only the place where I wrote my first lines of code ever but also the place that would teach what working in an office
                        even meant. Meanwhile I was simultaneously studying for a bacherlors degree in computer science at <a class="general-links" href="https://www.w-hs.de/">Westf√§lische Hochschule</a>.
